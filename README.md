# Recommedation system

### Explicit
- like
- ratings

### Implicit
- clicks
- Watch time


### Demographic filtering
(Recommended popular movies, this will not personalize. Just recommend the popular items)

### Collabarative filering
(recommended items to similar users behavior)

  - memory based (similar users behavior used matrix factorization)
  	- user based (find similar user like this)
  	- product based (find similar products like this)
  
  - Model based (this is using machine learning model to predict/get hidden patterns underlaying on data)


### Content based filtering
(recommend the video user previously liked , recomend the similar kind of videos)

- Liked videos
- Commented

Dataset , I am using [ml-latest-small.zip](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/) small one (1 mb)


Ps : In the project I will use movie-dataset , so the context is movie recommendation system.
In above I just go through the basic idea as whole
